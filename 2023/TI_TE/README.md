# Are Topological Insulators Promising Thermoelectrics?

This repository contains data from first-principles Boltzmann transport calculations on Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, and ZrBeSi-type ABX phases.


### Description

The Excel sheets contain the following data: 
* M<sub>0</sub> parameter
* Lattice thermal conductivity (kappa_L)
* Maximum *zT* for *n*- and *p*-type (max_zT_n, max_zT_p)
* 

The folders are arranged according to the names of the irreducible representation to which the molecular orbitals belong.

Note that there are two sets of t<sub>2</sub> states, which are organized into the lower-energy states and the higher-energy states.
