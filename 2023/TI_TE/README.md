# Are Topological Insulators Promising Thermoelectrics?

This repository contains rotating GIFs of the molecular orbitals of the Si<sub>4</sub> tetrahedron.


### Description

The folders are arranged according to the names of the irreducible representation to which the molecular orbitals belong.

Note that there are two sets of t<sub>2</sub> states, which are organized into the lower-energy states and the higher-energy states.
